## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Aman! I am currently working as a Lead AI Engineer at [RelevanceAI](https://relevanceai.com/). I have had to wear a few different hats in my career as part of my journey to becoming Lead AI Engineer - most importantly, I've had to continuously learn and grow, little by little - everyday. I was previously Data Science Lead at Australia's biggest real-estate company - [REA Group](https://www.realestate.com.au/) where I worked on Australian property price prediction models. Before that, I was working as Growth AI Engineer at Weights & Biases, a unicorn for model tracking/tracing based in San Francisco. I've also had a stint on implementing deep learning in Healthcare.

I code mostly in Python, and I also have some exposure to TypeScript. 

In terms of Infrastructure, I can build models that scale - during my career, I've used AWS to build models that scale upto 15M users per month.

You might know me from [my blog](https://amaarora.github.io/) - a special place where I write about AI stuff. I thoroughly enjoying writing and learning in Public.
